              (In short, art is magical, free, and huge. Everyone has a creative mind set, some show it better than others. What's important is that art can express almost everything, emotions/feelings, goals, achievements, trauma, etc. that's what makes art so powerful.)
              -Graphic Design Roots: 15,000 – 3,600 BC-
              “Graphic design can be traced all the way back to 15,000 BC, when the first known visual communications arose. These pictographs and symbols are present in the Lascaux caves in southern France. Fast-forward several thousand years, and you'll discover the Blau Monument.” (from google)
              The first real design in art came in Italy at the end of the 13th century, in the painting of Giotto and others.

              <p>
                <p>Software, digital programs for any needed information, creativity, and learning. Software is defined as the virtual programs that run on your computer; that is, operating system, internet browser, word-processing documents, etc.Software not only makes your computer hardware perform important tasks, but can also help your business work more efficiently. Software is known to carry out the input, processing, output, storage, and control activities.
</p>
                <h3>Input</h3>
                data that is entered into or received by hardware or software
                <h3>Processing</h3>
                the set of activities and associated outcomes that produce a software product.
                <h3>Output</h3>
                Data sent or delivered back to hardware or software
                <h3>Storage</h3>
                provides volume management, RAID protection, and LUN masking


                <h3>LUN masking</h3>
                a process of hiding or masking certain logical unit numbers (LUNs) from specific hosts or servers. A LUN is a logical representation of a physical storage device or a portion of it, such as a disk, a volume, or a RAID group.
                <h3>RAID</h3>
                RAID (redundant array of independent disks) is a way of storing the same data in different places on multiple hard disks or solid-state drives (SSDs) to protect data in the case of a drive failure.
                <h3>Control</h3>
                the process of the physical storage in a definitive software library of all software to ensure that only correctly released, licensed, and authorized versions of software are in use. Processes in this category include the tracking of releases, patches, service packs, and bug fixes.

            <p>
              <p>Hardware, the physical tools, machinery, and other durable equipment. Without hardware, there would be no way of running the essential software that makes computers so useful. Hardware refers to the external and internal devices and equipment that enable you to perform major functions such as input, output, storage, communication, processing, and more.
</p>

              <h3>Communications</h3>
              any type of hardware capable of transmitting data, instructions, and information between a sending device and a receiving device.

              <h5>There are two types of computer hardware: external and internal.</h5>

              <h3>External Hardware</h3>
              External hardware components, also called peripheral components, are items that are often externally connected to the computer to control either input or output functions.
              <h5>peripheral components</h5>
              Examples of peripheral devices (aka external hardware) include terminals, printers, external floppy disk drives and other data storage devices, video monitors, keyboards, interface boards, external memory expansion cards, and other input/output devices that may or may not contain digital circuitry.
              <h3>Internal Hardware</h3>
              Internal hardware includes components such as memory, a video card, or a CPU
              <h5>CPU</h5>
              the primary component of a computer that acts as its “control center.”
              <h5>Video card</h5>
              a printed circuit board controlling output to a display screen.

              <h3>Who inspired me-</h3>
              I would love to draw and invent many things that didn’t quite exist before, I was quite creative. I was inspired by my sister, she would draw better than me, be more creative, and overall the best. I looked up to her, both figuratively and literally. She was older than me by one and a half years so we had a lot of bonding time and almost never left each other's side. One day my sister asked me, “do you wanna draw with me?” I was excited and grew to love drawing. The present day, my sister only just doodles, drawing isn’t her hobby anymore. I would love to show everyone that drawing, even if you're not AMAZING, can still be magical.


              <h3>what steps did i take and what does it solve-</h3>
              When this idea came into mind I made so many componentes and spent hours on just what it would look like, how heavy it is, what the cost was, how it will affect the human mind,  etc. I made a list of things I think were essential no matter what it was, what problems it solves.


              <h5>Problems in design arts</h5>
              Material waste,
              Expense/cost,
              Time manageable,
              multi-tasking.
               </p>
            <div class="right">  <img src= "images/fp-s-2.png "  height="300px" width="450px" /> </div>
            <p> <p>A contraption where when you sleep you can create anything imaginable and when you wake up you’ll be able to have a picture of the design you made and add on.
               </p>
               <p>it can see your dreams or what you dream about. </p>
               <p>it can show the way you think, your desires, dislikes, etc</p>


              <h3>PROS</h3>
              <h5>Less material waste</h5>
              accruate proportions of materials without buying more or having too much extra
              <h5>original creative liberties</h5>
              can create almost anything imaginable, customers more satisfied
              <h5>Visual representation + dimention accurately (size and color)</h5>
              3d model, dimentions/size will be better to see (reduces returns and money spent)


              <h3>CONS</h3>
              <h5>Price</h5>
              with all the materials and the technological advancement in order to create this contraption it'll need a lot of money to care, use, and create.
              <h5>Space</h5>
              in order to add the projector, the screen, and the other nesseseraties, space will be neccesary
              <h5>Safety</h5>
              the contraption will be moneterating your brain
