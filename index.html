              (In short, art is magical, free, and huge. Everyone has a creative mind set, some show it better than others. What's important is that art can express almost everything, emotions/feelings, goals, achievements, trauma, etc. that's what makes art so powerful.)
              -Graphic Design Roots: 15,000 – 3,600 BC-
              “Graphic design can be traced all the way back to 15,000 BC, when the first known visual communications arose. These pictographs and symbols are present in the Lascaux caves in southern France. Fast-forward several thousand years, and you'll discover the Blau Monument.” (from google)
              The first real design in art came in Italy at the end of the 13th century, in the painting of Giotto and others.

                Software, digital programs for any needed information, creativity, and learning. Software is defined as the virtual programs that run on your computer; that is, operating system, internet browser, word-processing documents, etc.Software not only makes your computer hardware perform important tasks, but can also help your business work more efficiently. Software is known to carry out the input, processing, output, storage, and control activities.

                <h3>Input</h3>
                data that is entered into or received by hardware or software
                <h3>Processing</h3>
                the set of activities and associated outcomes that produce a software product.
                <h3>Output</h3>
                Data sent or delivered back to hardware or software
                <h3>Storage</h3>
                provides volume management, RAID protection, and LUN masking


                <h3>LUN masking</h3>
                a process of hiding or masking certain logical unit numbers (LUNs) from specific hosts or servers. A LUN is a logical representation of a physical storage device or a portion of it, such as a disk, a volume, or a RAID group.
                <h3>RAID</h3>
                RAID (redundant array of independent disks) is a way of storing the same data in different places on multiple hard disks or solid-state drives (SSDs) to protect data in the case of a drive failure.
                <h3>Control</h3>
                the process of the physical storage in a definitive software library of all software to ensure that only correctly released, licensed, and authorized versions of software are in use. Processes in this category include the tracking of releases, patches, service packs, and bug fixes.

              Hardware, the physical tools, machinery, and other durable equipment. Without hardware, there would be no way of running the essential software that makes computers so useful. Hardware refers to the external and internal devices and equipment that enable you to perform major functions such as input, output, storage, communication, processing, and more.


              <h3>Communications</h3>
              any type of hardware capable of transmitting data, instructions, and information between a sending device and a receiving device.

              <h5>There are two types of computer hardware: external and internal.</h5>

              <h3>External Hardware</h3>
              External hardware components, also called peripheral components, are items that are often externally connected to the computer to control either input or output functions.
              <h5>peripheral components</h5>
              Examples of peripheral devices (aka external hardware) include terminals, printers, external floppy disk drives and other data storage devices, video monitors, keyboards, interface boards, external memory expansion cards, and other input/output devices that may or may not contain digital circuitry.
              <h3>Internal Hardware</h3>
              Internal hardware includes components such as memory, a video card, or a CPU
              <h5>CPU</h5>
              the primary component of a computer that acts as its “control center.”
              <h5>Video card</h5>
              a printed circuit board controlling output to a display screen.

              <h3>Who inspired me-</h3>
              I would love to draw and invent many things that didn’t quite exist before, I was quite creative. I was inspired by my sister, she would draw better than me, be more creative, and overall the best. I looked up to her, both figuratively and literally. She was older than me by one and a half years so we had a lot of bonding time and almost never left each other's side. One day my sister asked me, “do you wanna draw with me?” I was excited and grew to love drawing. The present day, my sister only just doodles, drawing isn’t her hobby anymore. I would love to show everyone that drawing, even if you're not AMAZING, can still be magical.


              <h3>what steps did i take and what does it solve-</h3>
              When this idea came into mind I made so many componentes and spent hours on just what it would look like, how heavy it is, what the cost was, how it will affect the human mind,  etc. I made a list of things I think were essential no matter what it was, what problems it solves.


              Problems in design arts,
              Material waste,
              Expense/cost,
              Time manageable,
              multi-tasking.
               </p>
            <div class="right">  <img src= "images/fp-s-2.png "  height="300px" width="450px" /> </div>
            <p> 3d projector that connects to your ipad/electrons your using for art/design, and displaying it as a model to see before creation to save materials

              PROS
              Less material waste
              Less scraps cause of the size dimensions
              It would accurately show the dimensions of each part and give you the size and length of each piece in fabric to lower the chance of wasting so much fabric
              It could also show what you could use the scraps for, for example, a hairpiece, a dress piece, an accessory just to sell to make money
               The little scraps can be used to make little accessories to sell inorder to make more money to buy more fabric and tool
              Different outcomes
              different designs and different dresses that come from one design
              input one design and it would randomize everything to show different forms, length, hight, width, (size), color, fabric, etc
              Visual representation (size and color)
              would project the size and dimensions of the dress/design and the color as well




              CONS
              Price
              projector would cost a lot especially with all the additions and tools
              (kinda solved with the scraps thing)
              Space
              Space is essential with the projector, you need space for your table, fabric, and the projector
